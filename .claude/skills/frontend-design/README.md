# Frontend Design Skill

A skill for creating distinctive, memorable frontend interfaces that avoid generic AI aesthetics.

## How to Use

### In Claude Code CLI:

```

## What This Skill Does

- **Enforces bold aesthetic choices** instead of generic designs

- **Creates memorable interfaces** with distinctive typography, colors, and layouts
- **Production-grade code** that's both beautiful and functional

## Aesthetic Directions Available

- **Brutalist/Raw** - Stark, utilitarian, high-contrast
- **Editorial/Magazine** - Asymmetric, bold headlines, pull quotes
- **Soft/Pastel** - Muted colors, gentle gradients, organic
- **Retro-futuristic** - Neon, glowing effects, sci-fi typography
- **Minimalist** - Extreme restraint, perfect spacing
- **Maximalist** - Controlled chaos, rich details
- And more...

## Example Usage

```bash
# When building a new component
/frontend-design Build a hero section for a SaaS product with brutalist aesthetic

# When redesigning existing work
/frontend-design Redesign this landing page to be more memorable and distinctive

# When exploring options
/frontend-design What aesthetic direction would work best for a fintech app?
```

## Key Principles

1. ✅ **Choose distinctive fonts** (not Inter, Roboto, Arial)
2. ✅ **Commit to a bold direction** (no half-measures)
3. ✅ **Create one memorable element** people will remember
4. ✅ **Use unexpected layouts** and spatial composition
5. ✅ **Add meaningful motion** and micro-interactions

## What Makes a Design Memorable?

- **Typography** - Unexpected font pairings, dramatic scale
- **Color** - High contrast or cohesive palettes, not timid choices
- **Layout** - Asymmetry, overlap, breaking the grid
- **Details** - Shadows, patterns, textures, borders
- **Motion** - Purposeful animations that enhance meaning

**Remember**: The goal is to create interfaces people remember, not just interfaces that work.
